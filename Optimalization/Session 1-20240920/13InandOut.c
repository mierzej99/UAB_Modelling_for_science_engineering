     The syntax for printing values:
     %[-][0][width[.precission]][l][u]type
     - means left align
     0 means fill with 0 on the left
     l adds to the type the long version
     u adds to the type the unsigned version
     The possible types are:
        d or i   integer
        u   unsigned ineger
        o   integer in octal base
        x   integer in hexadecimal base
        c   character
        s   string
        f   real value (floating point)
        e   exponential form
        g   real vaule in form e, f or d
