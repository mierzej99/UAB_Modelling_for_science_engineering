// A (single) pointer is a variable which will contain an address of another variable.
// the pointer has also a type, which must match the type of the variable that is pointing to.
// The * is used both for declaring the variable and also for getting the value.
// The & is used to get the address of a variable (we have seen it when using scanf())
